1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,927
Mr Raven was perched upon a limb,

2
00:00:02,927 --> 00:00:06,179
And Reynard the Fox looked up at him;

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:09,757
For the Raven held in his great big beak,

4
00:00:09,757 --> 00:00:13,009
A morsel the Fox would go far to seek.

5
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:17,220
Said the Fox, in admiring tones: 'My word!

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,709
Sir Raven, you are a handsome bird.

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,827
Such feathers! If you would only sing,

8
00:00:23,827 --> 00:00:27,530
The birds of these woods would call you King.'

9
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,577
The Raven, who did not see the joke,

10
00:00:30,577 --> 00:00:33,939
Forgot that his voice was just a croak.

11
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:37,445
He opened his beak, in his foolish pride-

12
00:00:37,445 --> 00:00:40,950
And down fell the morsel the Fox had eyed.

13
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:44,821
'Ha-ha!' laughed the Fox. 'And now you know,

14
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:48,169
Ignore sweet words that make you glow.

15
00:00:48,169 --> 00:00:51,516
Pride, my friend, is rather unwise;

16
00:00:51,516 --> 00:00:55,419
I'm sure this teaching is quite a surprise
