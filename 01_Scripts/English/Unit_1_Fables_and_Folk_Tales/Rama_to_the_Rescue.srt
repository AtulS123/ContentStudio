1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,125
It was a quiet night in the village.

2
00:00:03,125 --> 00:00:07,113
Everyone was asleep, except for one couple.

3
00:00:07,113 --> 00:00:09,700
The wife whispered, 'Ssssh!

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,455
Listen!

5
00:00:10,455 --> 00:00:13,150
Somebody is trying to get in.'

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,311
A thief slipped through a cracked window into the house

7
00:00:16,311 --> 00:00:19,129
while the couple slept, his intentions unknown.

8
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,776
The husband whispered to his wife, 'The thief might be

9
00:00:22,776 --> 00:00:26,260
armed, so we must trick him into calling the village

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,610
kotwal.' She nodded, ready to act.

11
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:32,136
The husband asked his wife, 'If we have a son,

12
00:00:32,136 --> 00:00:35,949
what shall we name him?' 'We will call him Rama,'

13
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:36,997
she replied.

14
00:00:36,997 --> 00:00:39,857
'But what if he goes out to play and is

15
00:00:39,857 --> 00:00:42,240
far away?' asked the husband.

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,052
'How will you call him back?' The wife smiled and

17
00:00:46,052 --> 00:00:49,865
said, 'I will call him like this.' She called out

18
00:00:49,865 --> 00:00:55,012
softly, 'Rama?' Then she raised her voice, 'Rama!' Finally, she

19
00:00:55,012 --> 00:00:58,158
screamed at the top of her lungs, 'RAMA!

20
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:58,730
RAMA!'

21
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,820
Rama, the village Kotwal, was patrolling nearby.

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,424
He heard his name being called desperately.

23
00:01:06,424 --> 00:01:08,470
He ran towards the house.

24
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:11,649
Rama burst in and caught the thief.

25
00:01:11,649 --> 00:01:12,416
'Oh, Oh!

26
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:16,691
Some thief has dug his way into this house!' The

27
00:01:16,691 --> 00:01:20,090
thief trembled, 'Please, let me go!'

28
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,676
The villagers woke up and helped catch the thief.

29
00:01:23,676 --> 00:01:25,513
The couple thanked Rama.

30
00:01:25,513 --> 00:01:28,575
'Your clever trick saved you,' Rama said.

31
00:01:28,575 --> 00:01:31,900
'You called the right name at the right time!'
