Hello friends!

2
00:00:01,207 --> 00:00:04,087
Today we're learning about adverbs.

3
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:08,361
Adverbs are special words that tell us more about verbs

4
00:00:08,361 --> 00:00:12,542
- they describe HOW, WHEN, or WHERE an action happens.

5
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:16,629
They make our sentences more interesting and clear!

6
00:00:16,629 --> 00:00:20,774
First, adverbs can tell us HOW something happens.

7
00:00:20,774 --> 00:00:24,819
Look at these examples: The rabbit runs quickly.

8
00:00:24,819 --> 00:00:26,891
The turtle walks slowly.

9
00:00:26,891 --> 00:00:28,865
The bird sings sweetly.

10
00:00:28,865 --> 00:00:33,897
The words 'quickly', 'slowly', and 'sweetly' tell us HOW the

11
00:00:33,897 --> 00:00:35,179
action is done!

12
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:39,619
Here are more adverbs that tell us HOW: She speaks

13
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:40,377
softly.

14
00:00:40,377 --> 00:00:42,001
He laughs loudly.

15
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:43,950
They work carefully.

16
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,440
The children play happily.

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,662
Notice how most of these adverbs end with 'ly'?

18
00:00:50,662 --> 00:00:52,719
That's a helpful clue!

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,613
Adverbs can also tell us WHEN something happens.

20
00:00:56,613 --> 00:01:00,222
Listen to these: I will go to school tomorrow.

21
00:01:00,222 --> 00:01:02,597
We played cricket yesterday.

22
00:01:02,597 --> 00:01:04,211
She is studying now.

23
00:01:04,211 --> 00:01:09,150
The words 'tomorrow', 'yesterday', and 'now' tell us WHEN the

24
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,479
action happens!

25
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,058
Finally, adverbs can tell us WHERE something happens.

26
00:01:15,058 --> 00:01:18,541
For example: The cat is sleeping outside.

27
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,134
Come here, please!

28
00:01:20,134 --> 00:01:22,323
The birds fly everywhere.

29
00:01:22,323 --> 00:01:27,698
The words 'outside', 'here', and 'everywhere' tell us WHERE the

30
00:01:27,698 --> 00:01:29,390
action takes place!

31
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,378
Great job!

32
00:01:30,378 --> 00:01:35,321
Now you know that adverbs describe verbs by telling us

33
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:37,189
HOW, WHEN, or WHERE.

34
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:41,363
Remember: HOW - quickly, slowly, carefully.

35
00:01:41,363 --> 00:01:44,439
WHEN - yesterday, now, tomorrow.

36
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:47,735
WHERE - here, outside, everywhere.

37
00:01:47,735 --> 00:01:51,469
Start noticing adverbs in your reading!
