00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,248
Hello everyone!

2
00:00:01,248 --> 00:00:05,441
Today we'll learn about the Present Progressive Tense.

3
00:00:05,441 --> 00:00:09,723
This tense helps us talk about actions that are happening

4
00:00:09,723 --> 00:00:12,042
right now, at this very moment.

5
00:00:12,042 --> 00:00:15,699
It's like taking a photo of what someone is doing!

6
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:21,054
The Present Progressive Tense has a simple formula: We use

7
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:25,535
'am', 'is', or 'are', then add the verb with 'ing'

8
00:00:25,535 --> 00:00:26,519
at the end.

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,923
For example: I am playing.

10
00:00:28,923 --> 00:00:30,344
She is reading.

11
00:00:30,344 --> 00:00:31,983
They are dancing.

12
00:00:31,983 --> 00:00:34,060
Let's see how it works!

13
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,076
Let's start with 'I'.

14
00:00:36,076 --> 00:00:39,437
When I talk about myself, I use 'am'.

15
00:00:39,437 --> 00:00:42,685
Right now, I am studying in Grade 6.

16
00:00:42,685 --> 00:00:44,814
I am learning grammar.

17
00:00:44,814 --> 00:00:46,270
I am having fun!

18
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,639
See how we add 'ing' to the verbs: study becomes

19
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:53,999
studying, learn becomes learning!

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,384
When we talk about one person, like 'he', 'she', or

21
00:00:58,384 --> 00:00:59,950
'it', we use 'is'.

22
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,395
Look: My friend is reading a story book.

23
00:01:03,395 --> 00:01:06,527
The teacher is writing on the board.

24
00:01:06,527 --> 00:01:09,137
The cat is sleeping on the mat.

25
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:11,329
All happening right now!

26
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:14,847
For 'we', 'you', and 'they', we use 'are'.

27
00:01:14,847 --> 00:01:18,566
Listen to these: We are playing a board game.

28
00:01:18,566 --> 00:01:21,379
You are listening to this lesson.

29
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:23,792
They are running in the park.

30
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:27,409
All these actions are happening right now!

31
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:28,811
Excellent work!

32
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:32,515
Now you know the Present Progressive Tense.

33
00:01:32,515 --> 00:01:37,320
Remember: Use 'am' with I, 'is' with he/she/it, and 'are'

34
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,922
with we/you/they.

35
00:01:38,922 --> 00:01:41,124
Then add 'ing' to the verb.

36
00:01:41,124 --> 00:01:46,130
Now you can describe what's happening around you right now!
