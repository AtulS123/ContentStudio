Hi friends!

2
00:00:00,804 --> 00:00:03,861
Today we're going to learn about homophones.

3
00:00:03,861 --> 00:00:07,722
Homophones are words that sound exactly the same when you

4
00:00:07,722 --> 00:00:12,387
say them, but they have different spellings and different meanings.

5
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:14,640
Let's explore some fun examples!

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,340
Let's start with 'I' and 'eye'.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,872
When I say 'I', I'm talking about myself.

8
00:00:20,872 --> 00:00:23,885
But 'eye' is the part of my body I use

9
00:00:23,885 --> 00:00:24,508
to see!

10
00:00:24,508 --> 00:00:28,663
They sound the same, but mean different things.

11
00:00:28,663 --> 00:00:31,780
For example: 'I can see with my eye.'

12
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,646
Here's another pair: 'son' and 'sun'.

13
00:00:34,646 --> 00:00:37,782
A son is someone's child - like you are your

14
00:00:37,782 --> 00:00:39,752
parents' son or daughter.

15
00:00:39,752 --> 00:00:42,619
But the sun is the bright star in the sky

16
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:44,142
that gives us light!

17
00:00:44,142 --> 00:00:46,829
Listen: 'The son played in the sun.'

18
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:48,900
Let's try 'see' and 'sea'.

19
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,323
When you 'see' something, you're looking at it with your

20
00:00:53,323 --> 00:00:53,794
eyes.

21
00:00:53,794 --> 00:00:57,182
But the 'sea' is the big ocean with water and

22
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:57,652
fish!

23
00:00:57,652 --> 00:01:01,228
Here's a sentence: 'I can see the blue sea from

24
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,169
the beach.'

25
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,780
Here's a fun one: 'ate' and 'eight'.

26
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,433
'Ate' is what you did when you finished eating your

27
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:08,868
food.

28
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:12,174
'Eight' is the number that comes after seven!

29
00:01:12,174 --> 00:01:16,090
Can you say this: 'I ate eight bananas for breakfast!'

30
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:16,959
Great job!

31
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,114
Now you know that homophones sound the same but have

32
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:24,013
different spellings and meanings.

33
00:01:24,013 --> 00:01:28,748
Remember: 'I' and 'eye', 'son' and 'sun', 'see' and 'sea',

34
00:01:28,748 --> 00:01:30,294
'ate' and 'eight'.

35
00:01:30,294 --> 00:01:33,000
Can you think of more homophones?

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,450
Keep practicing!
