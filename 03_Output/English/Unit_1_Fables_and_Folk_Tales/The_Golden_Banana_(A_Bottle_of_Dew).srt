00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,204
Once upon a time, there was a young man named

2
00:00:03,204 --> 00:00:03,738
Raman.

3
00:00:03,738 --> 00:00:06,853
He was the son of a wealthy landlord, but he

4
00:00:06,853 --> 00:00:07,921
was very lazy.

5
00:00:07,921 --> 00:00:09,612
He didn't want to work.

6
00:00:09,612 --> 00:00:13,884
Instead, he spent all his time reading books about magic,

7
00:00:13,884 --> 00:00:17,000
hoping to find a way to turn dirt into gold.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,081
One day, a wise sage visited the village.

9
00:00:20,081 --> 00:00:23,797
Raman rushed to him and asked, 'Master, is there a

10
00:00:23,797 --> 00:00:27,875
magic potion that can turn things into gold?' The sage

11
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:31,319
smiled and said, 'Yes, I know of such a potion.

12
00:00:31,319 --> 00:00:34,310
But it requires a special ingredient.'

13
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,383
'You must plant banana trees,' said the sage.

14
00:00:37,383 --> 00:00:40,941
'And in winter, you must collect the morning dew from

15
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:41,912
their leaves.

16
00:00:41,912 --> 00:00:44,985
When you have five liters of this dew, bring it

17
00:00:44,985 --> 00:00:47,250
to me, and I will make the potion.'

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,045
Raman went home and started planting.

19
00:00:50,045 --> 00:00:52,753
He planted hundreds of banana trees.

20
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:56,597
Every winter morning, he woke up early to collect the

21
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:57,907
tiny drops of dew.

22
00:00:57,907 --> 00:01:01,140
It took him six long years to fill the bottle.

23
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,446
While Raman worked in the fields, his wife took the

24
00:01:04,446 --> 00:01:05,941
bananas to the market.

25
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:08,618
The crop was so good that she sold them for

26
00:01:08,618 --> 00:01:09,562
a lot of money.

27
00:01:09,562 --> 00:01:13,420
Soon, their house was filled with wealth from the harvest.

28
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,362
Finally, Raman took the bottle of dew to the sage.

29
00:01:17,362 --> 00:01:21,496
The sage chanted some words and sprinkled the dew on

30
00:01:21,496 --> 00:01:22,843
a copper vessel.

31
00:01:22,843 --> 00:01:24,670
But nothing happened!

32
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,208
Raman was furious.

33
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:28,420
'You cheated me!' he cried.

34
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,885
The sage smiled and called Raman's wife.

35
00:01:31,885 --> 00:01:35,044
She opened a chest full of gold coins.

36
00:01:35,044 --> 00:01:36,980
'Look,' said the sage.

37
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,853
'This is the gold you grew with your hard work.

38
00:01:40,853 --> 00:01:42,994
There is no magic potion.

39
00:01:42,994 --> 00:01:45,440
Hard work is the only magic.'
