# Story Script: A Bottle of Dew

**Narration:** Rama Natha was the son of a rich landlord. When his father died, he left him large tracts of land. But Rama Natha didn't spend a single day looking after his land. He had a funny idea—he believed there was a magic potion that could turn any object into gold.

## Scene 2: The Sage's Arrival
**Visual:** A famous sage, Mahipati, arrives in town. Rama Natha rushes to meet him, bowing respectfully.
**Narration:** One day, a famous sage named Mahipati came to town. Rama Natha became his follower and asked, "Is there really a potion that turns things to gold?" The sage smiled, "Yes, I heard of it in the Himalayas. But it is difficult to make."

## Scene 3: The Secret Ingredient
**Visual:** The sage whispering to Rama Natha. Rama Natha looks excited but then worried.
**Narration:** The sage said, "You must plant a banana plant and water it yourself. In winter, the morning dew forms on the leaves. You must collect this dew in a bottle. When you have five liters, bring it to me. I will chant magic words to turn it into the potion."

## Scene 4: The Calculation
**Visual:** Rama Natha calculating on his fingers. He looks distressed.
**Narration:** Rama Natha worried, "Winter is only for a few months. It will take years to collect five liters!" The sage replied, "You can plant as many trees as you want. But remember, you must collect the dew with your own hands."
